Getting the New Tile UI to Work

I have evrything nearly ready for use but I need to create a element for jobs.

The job elementy should have a total worker label
timer and progress progressbar
exp
and a quick work and stop job button

Creating the job element
I need to quickly set up a dublicate of the item ui element as it will share
simulare structure.

////////////////////////////////////
Job Control Panel in the Info Window

The Control panel will need these things.
1. Info on the among of people in the job and cap
2. A way to change the amount of workers in the job
3. allow the job to run for a certain amount of times
4. allow the job to repeat
5. allow the job to stop

Setting up labels
I need to place the labels an buttons that I will use in this

Creating widgets
I noticed that I keep using a spin box like node so I need to create a
base scene that will be used in other instances like assigning workers 
and repeating nums.

Creating a spin box
The spin box needs to display a number and have controls such as a less, more,
and reset button. then I need a way to set a minimum, maximum, and default number.

Control panel is now complete but doesn't have any functionality yet.
