## New UI

The game needs a mobile friendly ui and the current ui is really hard to read. the new ui will allow for more functionality with the tile and allow for more game data to be displayed.

#### Goals

1. Allow the user to look at the current selected tile's data
   1. current tile data
   2. current building data
   3. Decorations
   4. buffs
   5. flags
2. allow the user to select categories
   1. Tiles
   2. Buildings
   3. Decorations
   4. Jobs
3. Allow the user to remove things
4. New item buttons
   1. Detailed data on item
5. New job button
   1. detailed data on the jobs such as buffs and equations

The new ui system will take a long time to make but will be cruital for the later development of the game.

## Biomes

Biomes will add more diverity to the game and allow for more techs. To allow for biomes I will need to create a way to have singular biomes and multiple biomes. the singular biomes is easy with a selection but to allow for biome blending I need to create a new perlin map then assinge the biome values to it.

These will be added

1. islands
2. beaches
3. plains
4. forests
5. mountains

in order for this to work I will need to look upa tutoral on how to set this up.

## Structures

Structures will give more life to the world as right now it's pretty bland. these strucutures will just be flavor for now but it could help with unfavorable spawns.

New structures will inlcude
1. Shipwreck
2. palm trees
3. wild plants
4. trees
5. statues
6. abandoned centers
7. dungeons
  
These will need a perlin list for the genration tiles to allow this to work.

## building upgrades

buildings can now recieve upgrades

1. neiberhoods
2. stone dwellings
3. stone warehouses
4. wood warehouses
5. food storage
